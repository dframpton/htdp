;; Develop the function clear-bulb. It consumes a symbol that denotes one of
;; the possible colors: 'green, 'yellow, or 'red, and it produces true. Its
;; effect is "to turn off" the matching bulb in the traffic light. Specifically,
;; it should clear the disk and display a circle of the matching color instead.
