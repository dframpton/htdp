;; Develop the program height, which computes the height that a rocket reaches
;; in a given amount of time. If the rocket accelerates at a constant rate g,
;; it reaches a speed of g Â· t in t time units and a height of 1/2 * v * t
;; where v is the speed at t.

;; height : number number -> number
;; Compute the height that a rocket reaches in a given amount of time.
(define (height acceleration time)

;; height-speed : number number -> number
;; Compute height a rocket reaches from speed and time.
(define (height-speed speed time)
